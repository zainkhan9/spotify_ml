Final_Project_Notebook.ipynb is the notebook of all our compiled code from each of our respective branches.  The code is copied and pasted from our respective branches.  You may find it easier to read in the code from the individual branches as opposed to running the notebook in its entirety. The readme's in each branch should indicate which notebooks contribute to our individual code.  Please reach out if there are any questions about our code.
